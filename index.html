                <p class="para"> Beyond Classes was founded with a heartfelt purpose â€” to empower individuals with
                    disabilities and ensure they have equal opportunities to learn, grow, and thrive. What began as a
                    shared dream among a group of passionate educators and changemakers in 2024, soon transformed into a
                    committed movement toward inclusion and dignity for all.

                    Inspired by the belief that true progress is measured not by what we achieve, but by how inclusive
                    our achievements are, Beyond Classes aims to bridge the learning gap for those who are often left
                    behind â€” not because of their abilities, but because of a lack of support and access.

                    The idea took root as our team witnessed firsthand how the digital revolution and growing
                    educational resources still left a significant section of society underserved â€” especially those
                    with physical, cognitive, or sensory impairments. We realized that unless we built a platform
                    designed for every learner, the dream of an equal world would remain incomplete.

                    At Beyond Classes, we believe that disability is not a limitation, but a different ability â€” one
                    that, with the right tools, care, and community, can flourish and shine. Our programs are crafted
                    not just to teach, but to uplift, inspire, and include.

                    Because true education goes beyond books, beyond barriersâ€¦ and beyond labels.</p>

            <p class="para">At Beyond Classes, our vision is to build a world where individuals with disabilities are
                not just included, but truly embraced â€” in classrooms, communities, and conversations.

                We envision an inclusive society where every person, regardless of physical, sensory, cognitive, or
                emotional challenges, has access to quality education, opportunities to grow, and the freedom to live
                with dignity and independence.

                Our mission is rooted in the belief that disability is not a limitation, but a different way of
                experiencing the world. Through compassion-driven learning, accessible technology, and strong community
                partnerships, we aim to break down barriers, spark potential, and empower every learner to go beyond
                expectations.

                Together, we strive to create a future where inclusion is the norm â€” not the exception.
